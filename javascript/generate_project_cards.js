From January to March, I worked on the backend team where I gained agility in the Python/Django/GraphQL stack and learned the intricacies of database management. Then, from March to June I joined the Android mobile team in designing and implementing a mobile-centered PH. Over time, my detailed understanding of the backend combined with my newly acquired perspective at the frontend allowed me to narrow in on potentially untested user patterns that ended up uncovering major opportunities to improve the user experience. I didn't want this high-level knowledge to go to waste, so throughout my learnings I developed detailed internal technical and product navigation documentation, which went on to onboard 6 new full-time team members during just my time there.`,

Nothing prepared me for the emotional roller coaster of the first gen open mic - a session in which anyone around the room could grab the mic and give their first gen testimony. Up until that point, it felt like I was the single only person on campus having the first gen experience. Today, as a proud first generation college alumn and the first person in my family to attain a masters degree, I understand how important it is for first gen students to have knowledge, wisdom, support, and hindsight passed to them from those of us who are further along in our journey - it's the precise thing that we lack as first gen students. With that, it is an absolute honor to continue connecting with and supporting my fellow first gen students at Northeastern by being invited back to speak every year as a panelist during First Gen Week. ‚òùüèª `,
